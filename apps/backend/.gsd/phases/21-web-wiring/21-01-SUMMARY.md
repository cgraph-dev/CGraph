## Results

### Task 1 — Gamification API query functions ✅
- Added 8 standalone fetch functions to `gamification-queries.ts`:
  `fetchLeaderboard`, `fetchDailyRewards`, `fetchBorders`, `fetchTitles`, `fetchBadges`,
  `fetchThemes`, `fetchAchievementsList`, `fetchQuestsList`
- Follow existing pattern: `api.get()` with `.data.data` extraction
- Commit: `06576beb`

### Task 2 — Progression Customization page ✅
- Replaced all 4 MOCK_ imports (ACHIEVEMENTS, LEADERBOARD, QUESTS, DAILY_REWARDS)
  with `useState` + `useEffect` fetching from gamification API
- Added loading spinner during fetch
- Updated `categories.ts` to accept counts as parameters instead of importing mocks
- Gutted `mock-data.ts` with deprecation comment
- Removed MOCK_ re-exports from `index.ts`
- Commit: `d07978be`

### Task 3 — Identity Customization page ✅
- `useIdentityCustomization.ts`: Added API fetching for borders/titles/badges with loading state
- Removed MOCK_BORDERS (18 items), MOCK_TITLES (12), MOCK_BADGES (12) from `constants.ts`
- Kept PROFILE_LAYOUTS, RARITIES, and helper functions (non-mock)
- Fixed `borders-section.tsx` to use dynamic `ALL_BORDERS.length`
- Commit: `7eff76e7`

### Task 4 — Theme Customization page ✅
- `hooks.ts`: Added API fetching for themes with loading state
- Removed all 20 MOCK_THEMES from `constants.ts`
- Commit: `667a4608`

### Task 5 — Forum Admin Dashboard ✅
- Replaced 4 inline mock data blocks in `useForumAdminInit.ts`:
  - Analytics → `GET /api/v1/forums/{slug}/analytics`
  - Rules → `GET /api/v1/forums/{slug}/rules`
  - Mod queue → `GET /api/v1/moderation/queue?forum_id={slug}`
  - Members → `GET /api/v1/forums/{slug}/members`
- Added error handling for each API call
- Commit: `f39752e3`

### Task 6 — Chat MOCK_USERS (bonus) ✅
- `new-chat-modal.tsx`: Replaced MOCK_USERS with debounced `api.get('/api/v1/users/search')`
- `mention-autocomplete.tsx`: Removed local MOCK_USERS and `filterMockUsers` fallback
- Removed MOCK_USERS from conversation-list `constants.ts` and `index.ts`
- Commits: `b815771d`, `9e38212a`, `49530c45`

## Deviations

- **Chat MOCK_USERS**: Not in original plan scope but discovered during research and fixed proactively. These were in `modules/chat/` not in customization pages.
- **live-preview-panel/constants.ts**: Contains `MOCK_BADGES` used for UI preview decoration — intentionally NOT replaced as it's cosmetic preview data, not a data-fetching mock.
- **Admin store mocks**: Left for Plan 21-02 which specifically targets the admin dashboard.
- **No TanStack Query migration**: Followed existing Zustand + imperative `api.get()` pattern rather than introducing `useQuery` hooks into pages that don't use them yet.
